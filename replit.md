# Overview

This is a full-stack healthcare demo application called "NextViseAI â€” Healthcare Demos" that showcases telehealth and telepharmacy services. The application provides AI-powered voice agents, avatar consultations, appointment booking, prescription generation, and multi-channel communication features (SMS, WhatsApp, email). It's built as a demonstration platform with simulated functionality rather than a production healthcare system.
